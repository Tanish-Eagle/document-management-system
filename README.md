# document-management-system
This is an API to handle various documents such as invoices, reports, and letters. I implemented it from the book Real-World Software Development by Richard Warburton & Raoul-Gabriel.

This was a first time where I implemented a library, so if you find any mistakes and unusual things, then it is because of my inexperience.
